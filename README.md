European Option Premium Calculator

The program calculates the premium (price) of a European call or put option using the Black-Scholes formula to compute the exact option price based on user inputs and Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the average discounted payoff.

The user is prompted to input the option type (call or put), initial stock price, strike price, time to maturity (in months), risk-free interest rate, and stock volatility. The user may also specify the number of Monte Carlo simulation samples and the confidence interval for the results.

After computing the option price using both the Black-Scholes model and the Monte Carlo method, the program outputs the analytical price, Monte Carlo price, standard deviation of the Monte Carlo estimate, and the confidence interval for the simulated price.
